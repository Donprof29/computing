Problem:
Simo & Sons Pizza sells three types of pizzas: Margherita, Pepperoni, and Vegetarian. The prices of the pizzas are as follows: Margherita - $20, Pepperoni - $30, Vegetarian - $45. Write a program that allows a customer to order a pizza by entering the item number. After placing an order, the customer is asked if they would like to place another order. If the customer answers 'No', the program should end and display a message thanking them for their business. If the customer answers 'Yes', the program should display the menu list again and prompt the customer to enter the item number for their next order."
